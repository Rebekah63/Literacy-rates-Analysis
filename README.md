# Literacy-rates-Analysis
Analysis of Youth Literacy Rates for NGO Project Focus

## Project Objective 
The goal is to clean and explore data on youth literacy rates to help a non-profit organization identify regions and strategies for maximizing impact in increasing youth literacy

## Data cleaning steps:
- Initial Data Inspection
- Handled Missing Values
- Data Type Conversion
- Categorical Value Standardization
- Final Clean Dataset

## Key findings from Exploratory Data Analysis
The histogram of literacy rates shows:
- A bimodal distribution with peaks at both low and high literacy rates
- Most countries cluster around very high (>90%) or moderate (50-70%) literacy rates
- Few countries in the middle range (70-90%)

## Recommendations for NGO Focus
### Target Regions:
- Prioritize Central and Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa which show the lowest literacy rates
- Specifically focus on countries like Afghanistan, Niger, and South Sudan with very low youth literacy

### Age Group Focus:
- The <15 age group shows the lowest literacy rates, suggesting early intervention is crucial
- The 15-24 group shows improvement but still lags in many regions

### Gender Considerations:
- Female literacy rates are consistently lower than male rates across all regions
- Gender-specific programs may be needed in regions with large disparities
  
### Temporal Trends:
The data spans 2010-2018 - recommend analyzing year-over-year trends for specific countries to identify successful interventions

## Next Steps
1. Perform deeper analysis on:
Country-level literacy rates by age and gender
Year-over-year trends in target regions
Correlation between literacy rates and economic indicators

2. Consider supplementing with additional data on:
Education infrastructure
Government policies
Cultural factors affecting education access

This cleaned dataset and initial analysis provides a strong foundation for identifying the most impactful regions and strategies for the NGO's youth literacy initiatives.
